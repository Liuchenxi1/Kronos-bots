This innovative Bot streamlines the downloading and data cleaning processes, which previously required the involvement of three separate team members. 

By combining these processes into one, the Bot significantly reduces the time and effort needed to complete them. The bot automatically opens the website and logs in using Python's Selenium package, allowing users to select their preferred date range and initiate the download process. 

Once the file is loaded into Python, the algorithm cleans the data by removing unnecessary columns and pay codes according to user preferences.

In the second part of the process, the Bot links with Smartsheet to filter down employee working hours across different business units. 

At the end, Bot generates two key reports: an employee working hour summary and a business swap report, which enables supervisors to confirm the employee names/hours listed on the Business Swap. This automated process saves the team approximately 6-8 hours of work and allows them to focus on more critical tasks.
